# Countries and States Example

## Overview
This is a simple example of how to call an API using plain JavaScript and then affect UI elements based on the results.

It first calls an API endpoint to request a list of countries and populates a dropdown with those results.  Once the user selects a country, it calls another API endpoint to request the list of states/provinces/territories associated with that country, populating another dropdown with the state results.
